      Challenge driven full stack developer with a passion for efficiency. Ever since I solved my first bug I knew
      that coding is my passion. I believe that programming transforms the world around us.
      I started out as a junior software engineer. Reading code, attempting bug fixes, failing and
      adding a button here and there. Slowly building my knowledge base and experience. Fast forward to today - I am
      a full stack intermediate software engineer capable of transforming the world one line at a time.
